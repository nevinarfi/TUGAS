This task doesn't have audio. Read the question below and select the correct answer.

# --questions--

## --text--

Which sentence correctly uses `while` to show two actions happening at the same time?

## --answers--

`He coded a new feature while he listens to music.`

### --feedback--

The actions should be in the same tense to indicate they happened simultaneously.

---

`He was coding a new feature while listening to music.`

---

`He codes a new feature while he had been listening to music.`

### --feedback--

The phrase `had been listening` shows a completed action, not one happening at the same time as another.

---

`He was coding a new feature while he will listen to music.`

### --feedback--

`Will listen` refers to a future action, which doesn't fit with a simultaneous event in the past.

# --explanation--

The conjunction `while` is used to show two actions happening at the same time. It works best with continuous tenses to indicate that both actions are ongoing.

For example, in the sentence `He was coding a new feature while listening to music`, both actions are happening simultaneously, using the past continuous correctly.
