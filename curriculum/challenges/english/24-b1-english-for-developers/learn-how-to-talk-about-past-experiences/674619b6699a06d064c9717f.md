`debugging`

### --feedback--

This word refers to identifying and fixing errors or issues in code. Use the `-ing` form.

# --explanation--

The phrase `come up` means to arise, appear, or occur unexpectedly. In this context, Lisa is asking if any other issues arose while James was debugging. Example: `Something important came up during the meeting, and we had to address it immediately.` (meaning something occurred during the meeting that needed immediate attention)  

The term `debugging` refers to the process of identifying and resolving errors or issues in code. Example: `The team spent hours debugging the software before the release.` (meaning they spent a long time identifying and solving these errors)

Lisaâ€™s question asks if any other unexpected issues could be seen during the process of fixing code errors.
