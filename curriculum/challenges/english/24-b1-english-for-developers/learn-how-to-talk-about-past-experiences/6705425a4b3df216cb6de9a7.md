# --explanation--

`Database credentials` refer to the username, password, and other details required to access a database. These credentials must be kept secure and up-to-date to maintain the integrity of the system. For example:

- `I forgot my database credentials and couldn’t log in.` - You forgot your username and password for the database.

- `She shared her database credentials with the team.` - Someone gave their login details to the team.
