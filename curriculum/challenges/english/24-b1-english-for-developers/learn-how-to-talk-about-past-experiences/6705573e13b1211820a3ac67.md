# --explanation--

The Past Simple tense is used for actions or events that happened in the past. To answer Yes/No questions in this tense, use `Yes` or `No` followed by `I did` or `I didn't`, and the base form of the verb. For example:

- Question: `Did you finish the report?`

- Answer: `Yes, I did.` or `No, I didn't.`
