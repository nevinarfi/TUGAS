`James finded the error at first.`

### --feedback--

This is incorrect because `finded` is not the correct past form of `find`.

# --explanation--

The Past Simple tense is used to talk about actions that happened in the past. To make the affirmative sentence, add `-ed` to the base form of the verb. For example:

- `She fixed the bug yesterday.` - `She` is the subject, and `fixed` is the past form of the verb `fix`.
