# --explanation--

`Used to` is used to describe past habits or situations that no longer happen. To form a sentence in the affirmative, use this structure: Subject + `used to` + base form of the verb. For example:

- `She used to work as a frontend developer.` - She had a job as a frontend developer, but now she doesnâ€™t.

- `We used to meet weekly for team stand-ups.` - In the past, we had meetings every week, but not now.
