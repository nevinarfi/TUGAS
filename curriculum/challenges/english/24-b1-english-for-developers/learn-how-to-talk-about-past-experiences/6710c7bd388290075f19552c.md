# --explanation--

A `post-mortem` is an analysis or discussion of a project after its completion to understand what worked well and what didn't. For example:

- `We had a post mortem to see why the server went down.` - The team checked what caused the problem with the server.

- `In the post mortem, we saw the bug was missed due to no tests.` - The team realized they didn’t catch the bug because they didn’t test it.
