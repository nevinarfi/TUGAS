# --explanation--

The Past Simple tense is used to describe actions that happened in the past. To make sentences negative, use `did not` or `didn't` followed by the base form of the verb. For example:

- `They didn’t submit the report on time.` - They failed to turn in the report by the deadline.

- `We didn’t notice the error in the code.` - We didn’t see the mistake in the code.
