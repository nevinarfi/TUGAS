# --instructions--

This task doesn't have audio. Read the question below and select the correct answer.

# --questions--

## --text--

Which sentence correctly uses a time expression with the Past Continuous tense?

## --answers--

`The program crashed while I clicked the submit button.`

### --feedback--

This sentence is incorrect. Clicking is a short action, so it should use `when`.

---

`The script finished running when I pressed Enter.`

---

`At the time the server was rebooting, the users lost access to the system.`

### --feedback--

This sentence is close, but it's too wordy. A simpler form would be better with `while`.

---

`The loop stopped while it reached the limit.`

### --feedback--

This is incorrect. Use `when` because the loop stopped at the moment it reached the limit, not during a process.

# --explanation--

The Past Continuous tense is often used with time expressions like `while`,`when`, and `at the time` to show that an action was in progress during a specific moment in the past. For example:

- `She was writing a Python script while I was reviewing PRs.` - `While` describes two actions happening at the same time.

- `I was deploying the app when the server crashed.` - `When` is used for events that happen at a specific point in time.

- `At the time of the system update, they were testing the new API endpoints.` - `At the time` refers to a specific moment that aligns with another event.
