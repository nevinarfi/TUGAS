# --explanation--

A `design sprint` is a focused, time-constrained process where teams collaborate intensively to solve design challenges and test new ideas. For example:

- `In the design sprint, the team built an app prototype.` - The team created a basic version of the app during the sprint.

- `A design sprint lets us get feedback in days.` - The sprint allows us to quickly gather user opinions.
