Modal verbs express abilities, possibilities, advice, or obligations. They are followed by the base form of the verb. For example:

- `Could` is used to show past ability or possibility (e.g., `I could finish the task yesterday`).

- `Should` is used to give advice or make a suggestion (e.g., `You should check the security settings`).

- `Can't` is used to express impossibility or prohibition (e.g., `You can't access the system without credentials`).
