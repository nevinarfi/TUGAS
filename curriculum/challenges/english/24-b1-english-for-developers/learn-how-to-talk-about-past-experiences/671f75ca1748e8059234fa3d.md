# --explanation--

A `session` is a scheduled presentation or workshop during a conference, like PyCon, where participants can learn about specific topics. For example:

- `We'll have a brainstorming session tomorrow.` - The team will meet to share ideas.

- `I missed the last session, so I need the notes.` - The person needs notes from the meeting they missed.
