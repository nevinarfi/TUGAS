# --explanation--

The Past Continuous tense can be made negative by adding `not` after the auxiliary verb `was/were`. For example:

- `I wasn't working on the frontend when the build failed.` - The failure happened, but at that time you were not working on the frontend.

- `They weren't testing the database at the time of the crash.` - At the specific moment the crash occurred, testing wasn't happening.
