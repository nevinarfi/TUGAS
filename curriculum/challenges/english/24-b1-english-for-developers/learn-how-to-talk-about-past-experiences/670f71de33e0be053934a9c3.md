# --questions--

## --text--

Which sentence correctly uses the Past Continuous to describe an action happening during the project?

## --answers--

`We were constantly updating the user interface based on user feedback.`

---

`I was reviewing the projectâ€™s security protocols just yesterday.`

### --feedback--

This is close, but the action here happened just yesterday, not continuously throughout the project.

---

`We used to focus only on design aspects and user experience.`

### --feedback--

This uses `used to` to describe a past habit, not the Past Continuous tense.

---

`I did check the updates for security vulnerabilities, but not always in real time.`

### --feedback--

This sentence is in the Past Simple, not the Past Continuous.

# --explanation--

The Past Continuous tense is used to talk about actions that were happening at a specific moment in the past. It is often formed using `was/were` + `-ing`. For example:

- `I was writing code when the power went out.` - Describes an action in progress when another action interrupted it.

- `They were debugging the program while I was testing the new feature.` - Both actions were happening at the same time in the past.
