# --explanation--

AI stands for `Artificial Intelligence`, a field of computer science that focuses on creating systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human intelligence, such as learning, reasoning, and decision-making. Example: `AI is being used to improve natural language processing in chatbots.` (this means that Artificial Intelligence is used to help chatbots communicate in a more efficient way with humans) 

An AI workshop is a session or event where participants learn about AI concepts, tools, or applications. These workshops often include hands-on activities to help attendees understand and implement AI technologies. Example: `The AI workshop covered topics like machine learning and neural networks.` (this means that, if you attend an AI workshop, you may learn by practicing with things like machine learning and neural networks) 

In this dialog, Maria confirms that she attended an AI workshop yesterday.
