AUDIO REFERENCE:
Maria: While the speaker was going through neural networks, I thought about our project last year. I remember you would often stay late, fine-tuning the code until it was just right.

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio and complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Brian would BLANK stay late to fine-tune the code until it was just right.`

## --blanks--

`often`

### --feedback--

This adverb is used to describe actions that happen many times, but not all the time.

# --explanation--

When using `would` to talk about habitual actions in the past, it's often paired with time expressions like `every day`, `often`, or `once a week` to show frequency. For example:

- `They would meet once a week to discuss their development plans.` - They regularly gathered every week to talk about project goals.

- `He would debug his code every time he had an error.` - He made it a habit to fix issues in his code whenever they appeared.
