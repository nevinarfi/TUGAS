# --explanation--

In this dialogue, James uses the word `nothing`, which indicates the absence of any discovery. For example:

- `She found nothing unusual in the report.` (meaning the report had the usual characteristics)

- `We saw nothing strange during the test.` (meaning it was a pretty common test)

In contrast, in negative sentences, we use `anything` instead of `nothing`. For example:  

- Affirmative: `He found nothing.` (meaning there were no discoveries)

- Negative: `He didn’t find anything.` (meaning there were no discoveries)  

Notice that, in negative sentences and in questions with `did`, the main verb (in this case, `find`) is in its base form. The auxiliary verb `did` is what shows that this sentence is in the past tense. Examples:

- `They didn’t find anything wrong with the program.` (not finding anything was in the past)

- `I didn’t see anything unusual during the presentation.` (nothing unusual was seen in the presentation that happened in the past)

This structure helps avoid double negatives. James’s answer, `(I found) Nothing at first` (`I found` is implicit), reflects an affirmative sentence emphasizing that he couldn't find anything when he began his search.
