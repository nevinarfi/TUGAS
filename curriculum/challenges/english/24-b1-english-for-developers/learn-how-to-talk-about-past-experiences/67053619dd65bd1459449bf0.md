To `notice` means to become aware of something or to observe it. In the context of debugging, developers notice unusual patterns or errors in code or logs. For example:

- `I didnâ€™t notice the bug in the code.` - You failed to see the error.

- `They will notice the changes in the interface.` - They will become aware of the modifications.
