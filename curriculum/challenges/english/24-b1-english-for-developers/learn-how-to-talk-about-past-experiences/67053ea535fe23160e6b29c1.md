To `update` means to make something more modern or bring it up to date. Developers often update code, databases, or credentials. For example:

- `I applied the update to the app.` - You installed the latest version of the app.

- `She didn’t check for an update before troubleshooting.` - Someone didn’t look for the newest version.
