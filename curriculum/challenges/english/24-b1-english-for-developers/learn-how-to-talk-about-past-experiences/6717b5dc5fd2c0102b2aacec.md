Use `there was` for singular nouns and `there were` for plural nouns to describe things that existed or happened in the past. For example:

- `There was a bug in the code yesterday.` - A bug existed in the code, but it's in the past.

- `There were bugs in the last release.` - The latest release had more than one bug.
