# --explanation--

`Would`, `used to`, and the `past simple` all describe actions in the past, but each has a different use.

`Would` and `used to` are for habitual actions, while the past simple is for one-time events. For example:

- `Every Friday, I would code a new feature.` - You regularly developed new features on Fridays.

- `I used to run tests on my code every weekend.` - It was your routine to test your code during weekends.

- `I launched the app last month.` - You completed the action of launching the app once last month.
