# --explanation--

A `user interface (UI)` is the part of a software or system that users interact with, including buttons, menus, and layouts. For example:

- `A clean user interface improves the user experience.` - A neat UI makes the app more enjoyable to use.

- `The app's user interface guides users step-by-step.` - The UI helps users complete tasks one step at a time.
