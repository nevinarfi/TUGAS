# --expalation--

In negative sentences, use subject + `did not (didn't) use to` + base form of the verb. For example:

- `I didn’t use to know how to code.` - In the past, I didn’t know coding, but now I do.

- `She didn’t use to work with databases.` - Before, she didn’t work with databases, but now she does.
