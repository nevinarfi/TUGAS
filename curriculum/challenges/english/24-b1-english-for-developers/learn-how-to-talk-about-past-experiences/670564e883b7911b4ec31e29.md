# --explanation--

Sequential linkers like `first`, `then`, `after that`, and `finally` are used to describe the order of actions or events.

- `First` is used to describe the initial action.

- `Then` refers to the next immediate step.

- `After that` is used to introduce a step following another action with some distinction between them.

- `Finally` marks the last step in a sequence.
