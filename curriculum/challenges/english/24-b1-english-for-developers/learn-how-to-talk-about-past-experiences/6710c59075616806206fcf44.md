# --instructions--

This task doesn't have audio. Read the question below and select the correct answer.

# --questions--

## --text--

Which of the following is the grammatically correct question in the Past Continuous tense?

## --answers--

`Did Jake reviewing the security protocols during the meeting?`

### --feedback--

This uses `Did`, which is for Past Simple, not Past Continuous.

---

`Was reviewing Jake the security protocols during the meeting?`

### --feedback--

The subject should come directly after the auxiliary verb `was`, so this is incorrect.

---

`Was Jake reviewing the security protocols during the meeting?`

---

`Were Jake review the security protocols during the meeting?`

### --feedback--

This uses `were`, which is incorrect for a singular subject like `Jake`, and the verb should be in the `-ing` form.

# --explanation--

To form questions in the Past Continuous tense, invert the subject and the auxiliary verb `was/were`. For example:

- `Were you debugging the code while they were pushing the changes?` - Asking if debugging was in progress at the same time as the push.

- `Was she working on the backend when the server went down?` - Asking if she was working on the backend during the server crash.
