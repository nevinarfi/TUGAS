# --explanation--

`Neural networks` are a type of machine learning algorithm inspired by the human brain, used to recognize patterns and make decisions. For example:

- `A neural network can learn from data.` - It can improve its performance by analyzing information.

- `We used a neural network to recognize images.` - The neural network helped identify pictures.
