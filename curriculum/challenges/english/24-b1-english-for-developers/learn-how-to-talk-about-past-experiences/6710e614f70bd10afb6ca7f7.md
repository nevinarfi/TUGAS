# --explanation--

The phrase `What's on your mind?` is an informal way of asking someone what they are thinking about or what concerns them. For example:

- If a colleague asks you, `What's on your mind?` they may want to know if you have any concerns about a project or if you have new ideas to discuss.

- In a friendly conversation, it can also mean, `Is there anything bothering you?` or `What are you thinking about right now?`
