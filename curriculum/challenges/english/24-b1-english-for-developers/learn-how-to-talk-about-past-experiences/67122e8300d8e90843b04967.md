# --explanation--

`Security implications` refer to the possible risks or effects that a decision or change might have on a system's security. For example:

- `Storing data improperly can bring security implications.` - Bad data handling may cause security problems.

- `We need to consider the security implications before adding new features.` - The team must think about possible security risks first.
