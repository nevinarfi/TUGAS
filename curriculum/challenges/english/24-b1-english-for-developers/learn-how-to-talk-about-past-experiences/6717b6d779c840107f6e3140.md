# --explanation--

To `overlook` means to fail to notice or ignore something important. For example:

- `Donâ€™t overlook the importance of testing.` - Make sure to remember that testing is very important.

- `If you overlook this step, the project might fail.` - Missing this step could lead to problems with the project.
