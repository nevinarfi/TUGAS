A `security update` is a software update specifically designed to enhance security, often by fixing vulnerabilities. Keeping software up-to-date with these updates is crucial for protecting data and systems. For example:

- `I installed the security update to protect my device.` - You applied an update to enhance security.

- `They issued a security update to fix vulnerabilities.` - They released an update to address security weaknesses.
