# --explanation--

Yes/No questions in the Past Simple tense help confirm whether an action or event happened. They begin with `Did` followed by the subject and the base form of the verb. For example:

- `Did she attend the conference last week?` - This question asks if she went to the conference last week.

- `Did they finish the project on time?` - This question inquires whether they completed the project by the deadline.
