## --sentence--

`The system wasn't connecting to the database BLANK.`

## --blanks--

`properly`

### --feedback--

This word means in the correct or appropriate way.

# --explanation--

The word `properly` is an adverb that means doing something in the correct or suitable manner. For example:  

- `The application didn’t function properly after the update.` - This means the updates brought errors to the code.

- `Please ensure the document is formatted properly before submission.` - This means the formatting of the document has to be adequate for the submission to be accepted.

`Properly` is the adverb form of the adjective `proper`. Both words can express the same idea, but their usage differs depending on the sentence structure. For example:

- `The database wasn’t configured properly.` (the adverb `properly` modifies the verb `configured`)

- `This wasn't a proper configuration of the database.` (the adjective `proper` describes the noun `configuration`)

Here, James uses `properly` to describe that the system wasn’t connecting to the database in the correct way.
