# --explanation--

To `double-check` means to review something again to ensure accuracy. This is often done when accuracy is critical, like verifying important configurations or code changes. For example:

- `I need to double check the code before submitting.` - You want to review the code again to ensure everything is correct.

- `He didn’t double check the requirements and missed an important detail.` - Someone didn’t review the requirements a second time and overlooked something.
